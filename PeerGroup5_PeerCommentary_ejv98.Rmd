## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Problem 1

```{r}
l<-15
l
# [1]15
x<-1:8
x
# [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
ppois(q=x,lambda=l)
# [1] 4.894437e-06 3.930845e-05 2.113785e-04 8.566412e-04 2.792429e-03 7.631900e-03 1.800219e-02 3.744649e-02
# wasn't sure about this one... I wrote the command as if trying to find the cumulative probability. 


##Miguel: I did it the same way. However, you have calculated the probability of hearing 1 call, 2 calls, 3 calls... till 8 calls, and we need to calculate the probability of hearing more than 8, so you could try doing "1 - ppois(q=x, lambda=l)" that means not hearing 1 call, nor 2... nor 8, which would mean the probability of hearing 8 or more. Anyway, DIEGO found a more efficient way to do it than our, but I let him explain it to you ;) 

##Diego: As Miguel said, you have to calculate the probability of hearing more than 8 calls. You can do that the way Miguel did it or using this code: ppois(8, l, lower.tail = FALSE). The "lower.tail = FALSE" argument makes the function start from the opposite side so it gives you the probability of x being greater than 8 instead of lower than 8, which is the default for ppois.

```

#Problem 2

```{r}
dpois(x=0,lambda=l) 
# [1] 3.059023e-07
# I set x=0 because this should represent the minimum

##Miguel: Nice!

##Diego: Perfect!
```

#Problem 3

```{r}
dpois(x=3,lambda=l)
# [1] 0.0001720701
# I used the same idea as in problem 2, by setting x=3 (the minimum). I am getting values, but I am just not confident this is correct.

##Miguel: I think this is perfect.

##Diego: Perfect!
```

#Problem 4

```{r}
x<-c(0:30)
y<-dpois(x=x,lambda=l)
barplot(y,names.arg=x,space=0,xlab="Calls",ylab="Pr(x=Calls)",main="Probability of Mass Function")

##Miguel: I think this is good! You can set the colour of the bars by "col = colour" if you want to make it fancier :)

##Diego: Perfect! Commenting Miguel's code I found out that you can write directly "barplot(dpois(x=x, lambda=l), .....)" so you don't have to set the variable y, and I think that is a faster way to write it, although what you did is totally correct.

```

#Problem 5

```{r}
rpois(r=104,lambda=l)

##Miguel: Nice

##Diego: The code give me an error. It says: "Error in rpois(r = 104, lambda = l) : unused argument (r = 104)". I think the name of the argument is n instead of r, so it would be rpois(n=104,lambda=l)

```

#Problem 6

```{r}
r<-rpois(104,l)
r
 #  [1] 18 14 20 17 16 10 13 12 18 12 16 13 12 13  9 16 18 17 12 16 15 20 13 15 11 21 21 10 21 21 11 11 21 20 14 14
 # [37] 21 15 14 17 17 11 12  9 15 15 16 13 16 15 15 16 19 15  9 18  9  9 17 21 12 14 11 15 13 19 17 10 15 12 10 16
 # [73] 11 14 15 16 15 15 11 13 14  9 12 21 20 16 14 13 15 16 15 17 11 15 19  9 23 19 13  8 24 19 24 14
> hist(r,breaks=seq(from=0,to=30,by=1),probability=TRUE,main="Plot of Simulated Results",xlab="Calls",ylab="Pr(x=Calls)",xlim=c(0,30))

##Miguel: I think you are not calling the appropriate vector, because you wrote "hist(x...)" instead of "hist(r...)" that is the vector you set above with the 104 random values.

##Diego: As Miguel said, you called x instead of r, which are your simulated data. There is also an extra ">" before the function hist which gives an error. The rest of the code is perfect! Good job!

```
```{r}

##Miguel: I think you did pretty well! but you forgot to write the 3 main difficulties you had when coding (The professor asks for it in the section "peer commentary" "how it works").
